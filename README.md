Setting the environment variable for Google Speech API:
Service account is used,thus we need to set an environment variable.
We need to Provide authentication credentials to the application code by setting the environment variable GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS.
This variable only applies to your current shell session, so if you open a new session, set the variable again.

With command prompt:
set GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=[PATH]
